# Proper Database Model for Unsctructured Wind Turbine Vibration Data
## SMU Masters Program - Database Management Course - Spring 2018
### Authors: Casey Martinez, Matt Rega, and Kyle Thomas

### Introduction

Turbine vibration data has been stored in a MySQL database. A significant amount of analysis must be performed on these data sets. However, in order to fit into a relational database, the data has been stored as a BLOB along with associated meta-data. Storing data in this format has imposed limitation on the extraction and analysis. 

A document-style NoSQL database is perfect for this semi-structured dataset since the analysis data will be stored as key-value pairs with no strict constraints regarding data types or formats. MongoDB will be used because it is popular and extremely scalable horizontally.
